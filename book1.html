						<p>A team of human scientists is probing and examining the oceanic surface of the planet Solaris from a hovering research station.
						Solaris manifests an ability to cast their secret, guilty concerns into a material form for each scientist to personally confront.
						All human efforts to make sense of Solaris' activities ultimately prove futile. As Lem wrote, "The peculiarity of those phenomena
						seems to suggest that we observe a kind of rational activity, but the meaning of this seemingly rational activity of the Solarian O
						cean is beyond the reach of human beings". He also wrote that he deliberately chose the ocean as a sentient alien to avoid any pers
						onification and the pitfalls of anthropomorphism in depicting first contact.</p>
